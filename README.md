# 🛡️ SafeBuy – Shop Smart, Shop Safe

**A browser extension that protects users from online shopping scams by detecting fake e-commerce sites, shady sellers, and phishing attempts – in real-time.**

---

## 🔍 Overview

Online scams are evolving – from cloned shopping websites to fake seller accounts offering “unbelievable deals.” With no simple way to verify authenticity while browsing, users often fall prey to fraud.

**SafeBuy** is here to fix that.

It acts as your personal online shopping bodyguard, scanning websites and sellers **as you browse**, and alerting you to danger before it's too late.
